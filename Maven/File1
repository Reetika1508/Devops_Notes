When we run mvn install
- It creates the 'Target'folder and stores the maven dependencies in ~/.m2/repository/ Folder.
- The dependecies are downloaded from maven global online repository.
- when we run any maven command, it validates previous stages as well. (like mvn install will run mvn validate, mvn test implicitly)
